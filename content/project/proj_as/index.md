I am interested in addressing the queries as to whether the traditional news media still have significant influence on the formation of public opinion in the digital age? How do emerging media revamp the media lanscape as well as individualsâ€™ minds? The current ditigal age has generated new queries about the power of legacy and emerging media and their complex interactions.

My research tackles these queries through examining the network agenda-setting (NAS) model and intermedia agenda-setting (IAS) effects across legacy and emerging media.
