title: Misinformation and Misperceptions
---
Misinformation, fake news, disinformation, and various conspiracy theories peak online during presidential election years, health and scientific crisese, and even the daily states. I am particularly concerned with the negative societal ramifications and consequences of the spread of these sorts of information, including the crystallization of hostile attitudes between one another, the destruction of deliberative democracy, and the prevalence of the populism-based anti-intellectualism.


Against this backdrop, I have been examining the dissemination pattern and mechanism of misinformation, disinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories in social media platforms, as well as individuals' misperceptions revolving these information.
