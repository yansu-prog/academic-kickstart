title: Political Communication
---
I am interested in the role of communication behaviors, such as social media use (online information-seeking and opinion-expressing) and offline political discussion, in shaping political participation and public opinion. My frequently used models include but are not limited to the Differential Gains Model and the Communication Mediation Model.

I have endeavored to optimize the conventional Differential Gains Model by incorporating new ideological variables and extending the typology of the dependent variables, which has yielded brand new and significant findings.
