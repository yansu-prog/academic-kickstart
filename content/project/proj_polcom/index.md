title: Political Communication
---
I am committed to investigating the role of communication behaviors, such as social media use (online information-seeking and opinion-expressing) and offline political discussion, in shaping public opinion and participation. My frequently used models include but are not limited to the Differential Gains Model and the Communication Mediation Model.

I have endeavored to optimize the conventional Differential Gains Model by incorporating new ideological variables and extending the typology of the dependent variables, which has yielded brand new, intriguing and significant findings.
