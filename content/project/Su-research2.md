title: Political Participation

I am interested in the role of communication behaviors, such as social media use (information-seeking and opinion-expressing) and offline political discussion, in shaping political participation and public opinion. My frequently used models include the Differential Gains Model, the O-S-R-O-R mode and the O-S-O-R model.

In the past, I have endeavored to optimize the conventional Differential Gains Model by incorporating new ideological variables and extending the dependent variables, which has yielded significant brand new findings.
