title: Political Participation

I am interested in the role of communication behaviors, such as social media use (information-seeking and opinion-expressing), offline political discussion, in shaping political participation. In my past project, I have optimized the conventional Differential Gains Model by incorporating ideological variable, whcih yielded significant findings. My frequently used models include the O-S-R-O-R and O-S-O-R models.
